Known Bugs:
-3D view is disabled and pressing "update 3D" crashes. Why: it is really slow with high-res volumes.
Needs interpolation/downsampling. 

-when adding a new labelmap, it doesn't update the view until you scroll slices. so, just
slide the slider or hit left/right keys once, then the new labelmap will be visible. 

-only .mha files supported now. should be trivial to support other formats, patches are welcome.

-"user input" is not saved along with the label map generated. if you think it should be,
despite the file-size overhead, patches are welcome. 

-the default "active contour energy" works well for MRI but less so for bone-CT because of
the way bone surfaces tend to have (possibly much) higher intensity than the interior. 
better CT segmentation needs two things: a) make the "smart brush" have a settable window
while drawing, b) make the contour energy settable at startup; e.g. edge-based. 



=======================

Dependencies:   QT 4.7.x, VTK 5.6.1+, OpenCV 2.2+, Optional: ITK, Boost 

Warning: May or May not build on Windows in current states. Please send suggestions if 
it doesn't and you know how to fix it. 

Building VTK: you must have enabled "with QT" and "with QT OpenGL" in the appropriate boxes. 

Overall: build shared libraries in vtk and opencv, disable fast-math in opencv, 
don't build python/LaTeX crap.
