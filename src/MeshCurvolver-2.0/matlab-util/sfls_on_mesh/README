'sparse field level set on polygon mesh' in matlab by Peter Karasev.

Parts ripped from 1) code by Shawn Lankton and 2) C++ version by PK


Run the 'sfls_test.m', watch the interface evolve on the surface. The default
'force function' is rather dumb, just F = -z. Change this portion of code to implement
your force function:

F = -nv( Lz,3 ); % Force: function of data and geometry of phi
dCFL = 0.3;
phi( Lz ) = dCFL * F + phi( Lz ); % update phi along the level set phi = 0


Above, nv is an M x 3 matrix with (x,y,z) vertex coordinates. Hence -nv(Lz,3) is
the -z coordinate at vertices in the Lz list.
